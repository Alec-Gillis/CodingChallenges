# CodingChallenges

Leetcode grind for technical interviews. Mostly commented with write-ups about my thought process. Not meant to be perfect, just here to keep me on track and fill up those nice green squares on my grid... I enjoy these problems until they become a chore, which they are during interview season; so it goes. Please almighty Lord, let me pass an onsite early in the fall with a good offer so I can stop doing this nonsense that's suppose to show how good a worker I am.
